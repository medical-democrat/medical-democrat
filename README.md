- 👋 Hi, I’m @medical-democrat, aka Kevin Ford The Submariner
- 👀 I’m interested in democratizing all medical knowledge and learning resources in an organized way that allows any person with
     no medical education to begin a self-directed, group-connected, dedicated learning experience to gain the same knowledge
     as a medical student who has just completed their medical degree.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on The Medical Democrat
- 📫 Reach me via Twitter: @FordSubmariner
